<h3 id="proj">Research project log</h3>

<p> 

<h4>Week 0 (05/31-06/03) </h4>
<ul>
	<li>Arrived at JFK (NYC) after a long flight and we were greeted with pizza on the first night! Thanks <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~laf230/Index.html">Larry</a> 
		and <a href="http://home.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~lgallos/">Lazaros</a>. </li>
	<li>Prepared the initial student presentation introducing the problem I will be working on.</li>
	<li>An HTML tutorial was organized for designing user homepages, like this one.</li>
	<li>Visited Washington DC for the weekend, had quite fun!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 1 (06/06-06/10) </h4>
</p>
<ul> 
	<li>Presented the problem and plan of research to REU participants.</li>
	<li>James provided more historical background for the problem and sent some papers for a more in-depth literature review.</li>
	<li>Mikhail Khovanov presented the talk "Regular languages and cobordisms of decorated manifolds".</li>
	<li>Lazaros conducted the research ethics workshop.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 2 (06/13-06/17) </h4>
</p>
<ul> 
	<li>We explored a few more related problems surrounding the topic at hand, like reconstruction of partially balanced tableau and diameter of the graphs of persistent graphs.</li>
	<li>Met Bhargav Narayanan to discuss some problem in extremal graph theory (Ramsey-Turán type).</li> 
	<li>Robert Bosch delivered the lecture "Connecting the Dots: Using Combinatorial Optimization to Design Visual Artwork".</li>
	<li>Biked along the D&R Canal to Princeton.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Week 3 (06/20-06/24) </h4> 
</p>
<ul> 
	<li>James suggested me to work on a simpler class of persistent graphs called single blocking vertex graph for which we have a way of realizing them as polygons.</li>
	<li>Furthered my discussion with Bhargav on the problem and I will be presenting the notes I am reading in a couple of weeks.</li>
	<li>A fun social event Culture/Student day was organized this week that I enjoyed.</li>
	<li>Went to NYC (finally!).</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Week 4 (06/27-07/01) </h4>
</p>
<ul> 
	<li>For a while James and I thought to have obtained a class of persistent graphs not realizable as polygons but then we observed the mistake we made.
		Anyway, so we continued formulating and analyzing the different cases in single-vertex blocking graphs. The next aim is to generalize it.
	</li>
	<li>The seminar "A Systematization of Content Moderation in End-to-End Encryption" by Sarah Scheffler was organized.</li>
	<li>Another workshop by Lazaros, this one on scientific writing. It was good to hear on this from an actual scientist.</li>
	<li>Had been looking forward to the 4th of July celebrations, which was quite something.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Week 5 (07/05-07/08) </h4>
<ul>
	<li>This week we worked out the case of two concave regions having a convex vertex connecting them. Seems that piecing this altogether we might have a way to prove the general case of persistent graphs.</li>
	<li>Attended a seminar on the graph cities project ("Visual Exploration of Billion Edge Graphs") by James Abello.</li>
	<li>Nicole Shanahan presented "Perspectives on IP from Machine Learning and AI".</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 6 (06/11-07/15) </h4>
<ul>
	<li> Went on an amazing trip to the Nokia Bell Labs and saw some cool stuff like the anechoic chamber.</li>
	<li> Worked more on the problem in the case when we have more than two concave regions with some convex vertices connecting them.</li>
	<li> Attended the guided tour of Zimmerli Art Museum.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 7 (06/18-07/22) </h4>
<ul>
	<li> Had the final presentation and didn't manage to solve the problem but I am happy with the experience.</li>
	<li> Very excited to go back to Prague.</li>
	<li> Also met with students from other REU programs working in Combinatorics sometime during the program.</li>
</ul>
